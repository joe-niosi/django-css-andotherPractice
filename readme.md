-This project is improperly named, it most defintely isnt my first Django project, but rather just a fun project where I'm messing around with a bunch of different things and learning to use new features.

New Things:
    -Admin
    -Django debug toolbar
    -Practicing a little pure CSS flexbox instead of using Boostrap and using a media folder to hold user uploaded images
